                <p class="lead">
                    Kedarnath temple is one of the sacred pilgrimage centre in Northern India, located on the bank of
                    Mandakini
                    river at an altitude of 3584 meters above sea level. The historical name of this region is "Kedar
                    Khand".
                    Kedarnath temple is a part of Char Dhams and Panch Kedar in Uttarakhand and one of the 12
                    Jyotirlingas of Lord
                    Shiva in India.
                    There are more than 200 shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand itself,
                    the most
                    important one is Kedarnath. According to legend, the Pandavas after having won over the Kauravas in
                    the
                    Kurukshetra war, felt guilty of having killed their own Kith and Kin and sought blessings of Lord
                    Shiva for
                    redemption. He eluded them repeatedly and while fleeing took refuge at Kedarnath in the form of a
                    bafellow.

                    On being followed, the Lord dived into the ground, leaving his hump on the surface at Kedarnath. The
                    remaining
                    portions of Lord Shiva appeared at four other places and are worshipped there as his manifestations.
                    The arms of
                    the Lord appeared at Tungnath, the face at Rudranath, the belly at Madmaheshwar and his locks (hair)
                    with head
                    at Kalpeshwar. The Kedarnath and four above mentioned shrines are treated as Panch Kedar (Panch
                    means Five in
                    Sanskrit).

                    The Temple at Kedarnath presents an imposing sight, standing in middle of a wide plateau surrounded
                    by lofty
                    snow covered peaks. The temple was originally built in 8th century A.D. by Jagad Guru Adi
                    Shankaracharya and
                    stands adjacent to site of an even earlier temple built by the Pandavas. The inner walls of the
                    assembly hall
                    are decorated with figures of various deities and scenes from mythology. Outside the temple door a
                    large statue
                    of the Nandi Bafellow stands as guard.

                    Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the Kedarnath temple has exquisite architecture Built of extremely large,
                    heavy and
                    evenly cut grey slabs of stones, it evokes wonder as to how these heavy slabs were moved and handled
                    in the
                    earlier centuries. The temple has a Garbha Griha for worship and a Mandap, apt for assemblies of
                    pilgrims and
                    visitors. A conical rock formation inside the temple is worshipped as Lord Shiva in his Sadashiva
                    form.</p>
